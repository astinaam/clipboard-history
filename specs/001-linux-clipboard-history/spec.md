# Feature Specification: Linux Clipboard History Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-linux-clipboard-history`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Linux clipboard history app with global hotkey (Meta+V), system tray, pinning, and lightweight Qt6 UI"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Parsed: Desktop clipboard history manager for Linux
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: clipboard monitoring, history storage, global hotkey, system tray, pinning feature, cross-platform support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All key aspects clearly defined in BasePrompt.md
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flows for clipboard management workflow
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (clipboard items, pinned items, configuration)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No uncertainties or implementation details present
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Linux desktop user, I want to access my clipboard history through a global hotkey so that I can quickly retrieve and reuse previously copied text without losing my workflow momentum.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have copied several text snippets, **When** I press Meta+V, **Then** a popup window displays my clipboard history with the most recent item at the top
2. **Given** the clipboard history popup is open, **When** I click on any historical item, **Then** that item is pasted into the currently focused input field and the popup closes
3. **Given** I want to keep an important item accessible, **When** I pin a clipboard item, **Then** it remains at the top of the history list regardless of new clipboard activity
4. **Given** I want quick access to the clipboard manager, **When** I click the system tray icon, **Then** the clipboard history popup opens
5. **Given** I have reached the configured history limit, **When** I copy a new item, **Then** the oldest unpinned item is automatically removed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the clipboard contains very long text (>1000 characters)?
- How does the system handle duplicate clipboard entries?
- What occurs when no application has input focus during paste attempt?
- How does the system behave when clipboard access is blocked by another application?
- What happens when the configured storage location is not writable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST monitor clipboard changes continuously in the background
- **FR-002**: System MUST store clipboard text history with configurable item limit (20-50 items)
- **FR-003**: System MUST respond to Meta+V global hotkey by displaying clipboard history popup
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide system tray icon for manual access to clipboard history
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to click any history item to paste it into the focused application
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to pin clipboard items to keep them permanently accessible
- **FR-007**: System MUST display pinned items at the top of the history list
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically remove oldest unpinned items when history limit is reached
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist clipboard history and pinned items between application restarts
- **FR-010**: System MUST work on both X11 and Wayland display protocols
- **FR-011**: System MUST have minimal memory footprint and fast response times
- **FR-012**: System MUST store configuration and history in user's home directory
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle text-only clipboard content initially
- **FR-014**: System MUST display clipboard items in a clean, vertical list format
- **FR-015**: System MUST close popup window automatically after item selection

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Clipboard Item**: Represents a piece of copied text with timestamp, content preview, and pinned status
- **Clipboard History**: Ordered collection of clipboard items with size limit and automatic cleanup
- **Pin Status**: Boolean flag indicating whether an item should persist at top of history
- **Configuration**: User preferences including history size limit, hotkey binding, and storage location
